# Queues are FIFO !!!!
# we need to maintain:
# Enqueue   : ex : q.enqueue(1), q.enqueue(2),etc
# Dequeue
# front  : like an index but as a pointer(like head) in array!
# count
# size
# isEmpty

#since we need to maintain enqueue dequeue we'll just maintain an array!
# with all these functions having order O(1) !!



# Linked Lists are also FIFO: so its easier to code Queue using LL
# stacks are easy with Reverse of LLs or normal lists !!
